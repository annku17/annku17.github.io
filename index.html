        <p>Icanvividly remember therelaxation exercise a teacher introduced to the class, al the way back in primary school. It went like this: close your eyes and take some deep breaths. Imagine you're walking througha forest - it'speaceful, and you can hear the soundof birds singing and leaves rustling. You c o m e across abig, beautiful tree,and notice
            it has a door on the side. You opent h e door andinside is something very, very special. You spend some time withyour special thing, and then you closet h e door and leave, knowing you cancome backa t any time.

        <p>Decades later, when Iworked witha hypnotherapist to tryt o manage some phobias, they offered asimilar exercise, except this time I walked d o w n a spiral staircase,and at thebottomwas a cosy room, witht h e most comfortable armchair. It was completely silent, except for the gentle sound of awarm wood fire.
            Theidea of these exercises is that they create a mental safe place,s o m e w h e r e you can always retreat t oshould you need to escape for a while.
